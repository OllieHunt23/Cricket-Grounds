                The inspiration for the "Finding The Crease" website came from two passionate cricketers living in the heart of Wellington, New Zealand. The idea was born one Saturday afternoon when we were struggling to find an available cricket ground for a spontaneous match. Tired of sifting through outdated websites, social media pages, and contacting local clubs for availability, we envisioned a central hub that would bring together all the information about cricket grounds in the Wellington region.</p>


            <p class="text-colour">We realized there was a need for an easy-to-use, well-organized platform that not only listed cricket grounds but also offered details such as pitch quality, facilities, and availability. They wanted to make it easier for players—both casual and competitive—to find the perfect ground for their games, regardless of weather or season.</p>

            <p class="text-colour">Wellington, with its rich cricket history and vibrant community, was the ideal place to launch this initiative. We partnered with local councils, sports clubs, and groundkeepers to gather comprehensive information and create an intuitive, user-friendly platform. The goal was to encourage more people to get out and enjoy the sport, whether they were seasoned players or families looking for a fun weekend activity.</p>

            <p class="text-colour">The website has since become a go-to resource for cricketers across the Wellington region, Whether you're new to cricket or a veteran, Finding The Crease makes it easy to find the perfect pitch for your next match.
